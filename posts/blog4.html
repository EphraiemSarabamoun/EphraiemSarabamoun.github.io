                <h3>Disclaimer and Intro:</h3>
                <p>As a scientist, I am a servant of the truth. My discipline is founded on humility born of a desire to know nature and her secret workings. I believe that knowledge gained through the practice of honest science is redemptive and intrinsically significant no matter its impact. That said, I also seek to use my knowledge of the physical world to help mankind in any way possible, whether by reducing their suffering or adding to their happiness.</p>

                <p>My code of ethics as a scientist is rooted in my devotion to truth and honesty. Therefore, my first and most important ethic as a researcher is to always be truthful and honest in my work. It is my responsibility to ensure that the results I report are accurate and reliable. This does not mean that I need or must report all results. It is my task as a communicator to streamline and curate my results so as to effectively impart my findings to others. I understand that straddling the line between truthfulness and effective communication is difficult, so I will use the following general guiding principles moving forward:</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type: number;">
                    <li>
                        If the results of an experiment are presented, then any experimental source of error which significantly threatens the veracity of the results must be mentioned. Other experimental details should be carefully recorded at the time of the experiment and made freely available if requested.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Not all experimental results should be presented. Results from poorly controlled experiments can be neglected, but reproducible, controlled results which contradict predictions or previous data must be shown or at least acknowledged.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While planning and conducting experiments, I will err on the side of skepticism. I will adopt the role of an impartial, reasonable and logical reviewer in questioning the veracity of my results and of my deductions. This strategy will allow me to develop my thinking and plan out clever experiments to tease out the truth. In publications or external talks, however, I will adopt the role of a truthful but persuasive communicator and utilize all ethical means possible to convince others of the importance and veracity of my results and of my interpretation. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since all these situations can be tricky to navigate, I will use my conscience to identify potential morally hazardous situations. If a difficult ethical issue arises, I will conferee with a respected, trusted colleague to help give me unbiased direction.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>In addition to truth and honesty, I strive to allow my research work to follow my curiosity and my sense of meaning. All scientific knowledge is based on the fundamental human desire to know. I recognize that the best scientific work is usually done when guided by a spirit of genuine curiosity and a passionate pursuit of fundamental truths. I will strive as much as it is in my power to move into research fields and topics which genuinely interest me. Nevertheless, during working hours, I will balance my free roaming curiosity with my responsibilities to my funding agency, my advisor, and my lab mates. </p>
                
                <p>I strive to maximize my effectiveness as a researcher. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve as a scientist, and I see it as my obligation to those who invested in me along the way to work as effectively and productively as possible to uncover as much truth as I can in this phase of my life. I take full responsibly for my effectiveness and productivity as a researcher and seek to use all ethical means at my disposal to advance my work.</p>
                
                <p>I strive to help and mentor those engaged in scientific discovery around me. I do this not seeking any reward, but for two reasons:</p>

                <ul style="list-style-type: number;">
                    <li>
                        As a token of my gratitude to all those who have helped me be who I am.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Out of a recognition that acting rightly is the only thing that truly matters in the end.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>I am a scientist, and this is my code.</p>

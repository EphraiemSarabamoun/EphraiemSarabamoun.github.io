                <h2>Sura 1</h2>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, it can sometimes be difficult to recognize a fairy. Generally, they are quite good at disguise, and it is not at all improbable that you have met a fairy without knowing it. Recognizing a fairy is difficult but possible if you know what to look for. Physically, fairies are small in size, have round, curious eyes, and often move with an excited skip in their step. But the best way to recognize a fairy is by the atmosphere they tend to create around them. It’s hard to describe the atmosphere exactly, but if you've spent time around fairies, you know exactly what I mean. Every time I am with my dear friend, Dr. Fairy, I am continually shocked by his actions and his perspective on the world. Take, for instance, the time we were escorted out of Staples because Dr. Fairy was fascinated by a pair of scissors and ran around giddy with excitement cutting everything cuttable in sight. Or another occasion when I had to navigate a thorny situation with a police officer after Dr. Fairy climbed up a traffic light simply “to see if he could do it”. </p>
                <p>Recently, another such instance occurred. The story begins in my apartment where Dr. Fairy and I were engaged in a heated debate as to whether machines would replace humans and fairies (Though his specialty is in bubbles, Dr. Fairy is a true scholar, interested in all exciting subjects). To settle the matter, we decided to go and see the machines for ourselves. I booked us some flights to go. In retrospect, I should have known that flying would have a strong effect on Dr. Fairy, but it had been some time since I had seen fairies, and I had slipped back into human ways of thinking where flying through the air in a giant metal box can be only a means to an end. (It’s sadly all too easy to slip back into human ways of thinking without fairies in your life.)</p>
                <p>Well, the moment we got in sight of the airport I realized my mistake. When I told Dr. Fairy the flying objects in the sky were the gigantic metal planes on the runway, he at first thought I was playing a prank on him (a common practice in Fairyland). But after he saw a plane take off, his disbelief was replaced with shock, and when I told him that we were going to ride in such a plane and travel to our destination through the sky, his shock gave way to the most stunned expression I had ever seen. Poor Dr. Fairy was in a state of shock, and I had to effectively carry him through the airport. At the gate, while waiting to board, he watched with head glued to the window one plane after another taking off from the runway, giving little gasps every time a plane left the ground. </p>
                <p>I tried to reassuring Dr. Fairy, but to no avail. “All these people are flying with us?” he asked incredulously, pointing to the other passengers. “Yes,” I replied. “But… how can they be so calm? Humans are so brave. I am scared and I don’t know if I can do this.” I just laughed, “well it’s not really bravery I think, it’s more that we are used to it, and we trust the plane and the people driving it … well mostly trust” I said. “Wait, someone drives this thing!?” he said. “Yes, the pilot. You might meet him when we board.”</p>
                <p>As we boarded, sure enough, the pilot was there greeting incoming passengers. He was a middle-aged man in a neat uniform, obviously tired and sleep deprived, and looking rather defeated. “Is that the pilot” Dr. Fairy said, his voice quivering with excitement and admiration. “Yes, it is” I said. You should have seen how Dr. Fairy’s face lit up. He hesitated (a thing not too common for him) clearly unsure whether he could/should approach such a superior person. “You want to talk to him?” I asked. “Oh, no, I can’t. He’s probably too busy anyway.” Dr. Fairy said bashfully. It fell to me to start the conversation with the pilot, so I said “Nice day today.” “Yes, weather is getting better in the East Coast,” said the pilot. With the ice broken, Dr. Fairy started timidly, “so … you fly this?” he said. “Yep, and I have flown it for the last 10 years”, said the pilot. Now Dr. Fairy was beside himself with admiration. “Ten years!  You must have been to so many places!” “Yep, all over the world” the pilot said, Dr. Fairy could only shake his head in disbelief then murmured “incredible”.</p>
                <p>I began to notice something happening with the pilot that I had often seen happen to people who interact with fairies. Humans and fairies both feel wonder, but fairies for some reason never forget, and when you talk with a fairy, you begin to remember what you forgot, and when you remember, it is easy to be very happy. “Kinda cool isn’t it,” said the pilot. Dr. Fairy could only nod his head. “Yep, I have been flying commercial airlines for 10 years now, before that I flew cargo planes for the Airforce. Those planes were even bigger than this one.” “You are so brave”, Dr. Fairy let slip. The pilot laughed. Then after a pause, he looked around to make sure the coast was clear and said “Would you want to see the cockpit. I am not supposed to, but I can just show you very quickly before takeoff.” He opened the cockpit door, and gave us a brief excited tour while Dr. Fairy stared in wonder at the controls. After the tour, we politely thanked the pilot and continued on to our seats, but I swear that when we left him, the pilot looked about 10 years younger, and on the PA afterwards he sounded happy and made many silly jokes. Dr. Fairy also was happy and laughed at all the jokes with the joy and swagger of heroes who sail the sky and laugh in the teeth of danger.</p>

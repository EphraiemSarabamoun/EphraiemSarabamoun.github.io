                <h2>Disclaimer and Intro:</h2>
                <p>First, I really should start this by saying that I am absolutely not an expert on this topic. I am only a beginner "sharing notes" with other beginners on a topic to which I have given some attention over the past few weeks. I think though that this article might be helpful to anyone who, like me, has recently signed up for their first triathlon and who has little to no prior experience biking. This is meant to give you a quick overview of what you need to buy to get started. I ask beginner to take everything I say with a grain of salt, and I encourage any individuals more experienced than myself to correct me if I get anything wrong so as to give the best possible advice to those who are just about to begin this journey </p>

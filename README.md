The styling and organization of this website draws heavily from source code obtained from Samuel Schmidgall's repo: https://github.com/SamuelSchmidgall/SamuelSchmidgall.github.io (Which in turn uses source code from https://jonbarron.info/). Feel free to clone this code for your own personal use (though I ask that you please cite the source for the blog html files)
